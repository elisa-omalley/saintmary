            <p>Saint Mary the Virgin cemetery is located next to Saint Mary The Virgin Church on 4354 Metchosin Road.
              In 1871, John Witty donated a section of his farmland to the community, to be used as a church and a school. 
              Saint Mary the Virgin Church was Consecrated in 1873, and in 1876, church yard was fenced off and the grounds were designated as a cemetery.
              Saint Mary’s church was used as an Anglican Parish until 1991, when it was reconstructed down the road. Many of the occupants of the cemetery were buried under the Church of England; however, 
              there are some exceptions. John Witty’s father Enos Thibault, was a Roman Catholic. The original church remains a historical site and stills holds events, such as weddings and funerals.

              One of the most important monuments in the Saint Mary’s cemetery is that of John Witty.
              Witty was a farmer, blacksmith and a pioneer of Metchosin.
              Witty moved to Metchosin after the San Juan dispute and bought the farmland known as Bilston Creek Farm. 
              The Bilston Creek farmland was originally established in 1853, and was the first farm owned and operated outside 
              of the Hudson’s Bay Company. The farm changed hands four times before John Witty bought it in 1867, and it has stayed 
              in the family since. In 1871, he gifted the church two acres of his farmland. The intention was to build a much-needed 
              church and school for the community. John and his wife Charlotte had a total of eight children, unfortunately two of them
              died before adulthood. In 1873, John Witty passed away when a false blow with a small hammer caused a knee injury rapidly
              proved to be fatal. The incident happened days before the Consecration of Saint Mary’s and Witty was unable 
              to attend. The first service in the church was his funeral. John Witty and his wife Charlotte are buried together in Saint Mary
              the Virgin Cemetery. John Witty is part of another monument in the cemetery; a marble plaque that reads: “In Memory of the late John
              Witty/ as a token of their esteem for his liberty in donating land for the Church, School, and Cemetery.”
